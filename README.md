The Aether is a dimension high in the sky composed of floating islands. Ascend through a Glowstone portal and begin a new survival adventure packed with new ores, mythical creatures and perilous Dungeons. All you need to do is build a Glowstone frame and add water to light the mystical portal, step in and you'll be transported immediately to the luscious hostile paradise known as the Aether.
