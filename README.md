The Aether is a dimension high in the sky composed of floating islands. Ascend through a Glowstone portal and begin a new survival adventure packed with new ores, mythical creatures and perilous Dungeons. All you need to do is build a Glowstone frame and add water to light the mystical portal, step in and you'll be transported immediately to the luscious hostile paradise known as the Aether.

You can download the mod on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aether) or the [releases tab](https://github.com/kalucky0/The-Aether/releases) on github.
